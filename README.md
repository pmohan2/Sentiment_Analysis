Authors: **Praveen Mohan**

---

## Introduction
*This project utilizes the abilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in building Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis model for analyzing the transcripts of some of the most popular US Presidential speeches in the history.*
*In simple words NLP is a technique which is used to mine the raw text or transcript data to gather valuable information or to make sense out of the raw data. This project will help us understand how each president’s speech had an impact in the elections and among the people and also help us identify patterns, similarities and differences within each president’s speeches.*
*The Sentiment Analysis is a technique that analyses the emotions involved in a transcript. It helps us identify the kinds of common emotions that each president uses and also helps us to understand the impact of various emotions among people.*

## Data Gathering 

### Web Scrapping 
* **`requests`**
* **`BeautifulSoup`**

## Data Cleaning -  Text Pre-processing  

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Approach

**Data Cleaning steps on all texts:**
* Make text all lower case
* Remove punctuation
* Remove numerical values
* Remove common non-sensical text
* Tokenize text
* Remove stop words


**Data Cleaning steps after Tokenization:**
* Stemming / lemmatization
* Parts of speech tagging
* Create bi-grams or tri-grams or n-grams
* Deal with typos
* And more...

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## `wordcloud`

**A tag cloud (word cloud or wordle or weighted list in visual design) is a novelty visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites, or to visualize free form text. Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size and color.**

## Sentiment Analysis

1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.
2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.
   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.
   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or objective (opinionated) a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.
